# Silvana Network

Silvana Network is a decentralized infrastructure that enables secure data storage, proof generation, and transaction processing while maintaining privacy and scalability.

Silvana Network shall include the following types of nodes:

### Data Availability & Mutable State Nodes

Manage decentralized data storage and dynamic updates governed by cryptographic proofs.

### Proof Generation Nodes

Generate zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring secure data operations without revealing private inputs.

### Distributed SQL Database Nodes

These nodes provide standard SQL interfaces on top of the decentralized data and enforce cryptographic checks for data accuracy.

### Staking Nodes

Let token holders stake their Silvana tokens, securing the network and earning rewards.

### Restaking Nodes

Offer staking services for the Silvana Truth Marketplace, letting agents access shared staking pools for proof generation.

Each Silvana Network node may perform one or more roles in the ecosystem, either as private corporate infrastructure or as part of the public Silvana network.
