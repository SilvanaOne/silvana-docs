## How Silvana Can Apply

The table below features the use cases we're targeting now:

| Use Case                                          | Problem                                                                                                                                                                                 | Solution                                                                                                                                                                         | Benefits                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Reinsurance                                       | Insurers need to mitigate significant risks, such as those in aviation and oil rigs, without overexposing sensitive details. Manual processes are slow and susceptible to data leakage. | Silvana leverages zero-knowledge proofs to facilitate secure quote requests from multiple reinsurers.                                                                            | - Potential 20%+ Savings on Reinsurance Premiums<br/>- Larger Pool of Reinsurers<br/>- Automated Compliance Checks |
| Bookkeeping, Accounting, Due Diligence, and Audit | Traditional accounting methods are susceptible to human error, fraud, and slow reconciliation processes.                                                                                | Silvana's object-centric, event-based architecture revolutionizes accounting by transforming double-entry systems into triple-entry accounting, complete with on-chain receipts. | - Continuous Auditing<br/>- Preserved Privacy<br/>- Cost Reduction                                                 |
| Gaming Object Management                          | The state of a gaming object can be covertly altered, potentially leading to gaming fraud.                                                                                              | Silvana meticulously records and monitors the state of all created objects, ensuring comprehensive tracking and security.                                                        | - Mutable, Provable, and Traceable Object States<br/>- Private Data Concealment<br/>- Enhanced Gaming Logic        |
| Document Verification                             | Notaries are trusted to verify documents, yet instances of document forgery or criminal conspiracy still occur.                                                                         | Silvana ensures document validity and verifies ownership, providing a secure and reliable solution.                                                                              | - Eliminated Fraud and Forgery Risk<br/>- Continuous Document Availability<br/>- Private Data Concealed            |

## Ecosystem & Marketplace

Silvana will actively engage third-party technology integrators â€” companies that consolidate market segments to provide technological solutions. These integrators can seamlessly incorporate Silvana's solutions into existing corporate systems and develop additional modules and blueprints for Silvana's application layer. This approach will expand Silvana's enterprise reach without necessitating extensive in-house development resources, ultimately building a comprehensive Silvana ecosystem.

As the Silvana ecosystem matures, numerous valuable objects and entities will emerge, ready for third parties to utilize. These assets can be seen, reused, bought, sold, or borrowed. This is where the Silvana marketplace comes into play, offering such valuable objects for public use. Among such objects are modules, blueprints, zkPrograms, assets (provable records), provable record templates, proofs, proof rights, and more.

### Truth Marketplace

One of the Marketplace corner cases is Silvana's Truth Marketplace, the proof marketplace. There are multiple proofs for a single operation with a provable record. Some may be more truthful and trustworthy than others. Truth Marketplace helps users find and obtain them.

This is the normal flow of Silvana's Truth Marketplace:

- Marketplace users can buy and sell proofs of truth, some access-based
- Enterprises might sell reconciliation proofs to counterparties for year-end financial liabilities, enabling compliance or audit checks without revealing full data sets
- Combining multiple proofs increases the overall "truth probability," considering correlations

Each layer offers unique properties and advantages, producing proofs of truth with probabilities estimated by leading crypto experts.

Depending on their number and correlation, several proofs can be combined to create a single proof with a higher truth probability. Clients can mix different types of proofs to achieve the best truth probability-to-price ratio.

The calculated proofs layer provides the highest truth. Other layers can be used if the computed proofs layer is unavailable for specific data.

Editing provable data removes confidential information from client data, keeping it hidden from agents. Proofs are generated for the edited data, ensuring the unedited data remains unchanged and secure.
