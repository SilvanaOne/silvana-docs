# Meet Silvana

![Silvana Docs Top](../Documentation/silvana-docs-top.png)

## Introduction

**Silvana** is an ultra-fast prover engine and operational system that lets developers build and run applications across Web3 and corporate systems. 

With Silvana, both on- and off-chain business assets and data are handled as objects with provable states, enforced by cryptography and defined logic.

Every app runs as a stand-alone rollup with its own infra, powered by modular agents and orchestrated by the Coordination Layer, delivering sub-second execution with guaranteed ZK-backed finality.

## What Can You Do with Silvana?

We offer a multifunctional platform using which you can:

* Prove any business data in day-to-day operations without disclosing it using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs);

* Bring corporate data and assets on-chain;

* Build and deploy applications as a zk rollup using agents for ease and automation;

* Implement and roll out any custom logic in plug-and-play modules;

* Effectively handle corporate assets, including tokenized real-world assets (RWAs);

* Execute business logic privately, in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE);

* Store corporate assets as provable objects in a DA or in a private database;

* Integrate with the battle-tested on-chain infra and networks for streamlined operation.

As you can see, there are lots of nice things you can do with Silvana. Just kick in and give it a try. Grow wild and free with us!
