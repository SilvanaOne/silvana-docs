# Meet Silvana

Welcome to **Silvana** - an ultra-fast platform where enterprises can build their business solutions using **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** to prove private data without disclosing it and provable records to stand for their real-world or digital assets.

Silvana is in a way AWS in Web3 that allows for flexible deployment across various environments, making it chain-agnostic and highly scalable. It offers composable modular object-centric design empowering businesses to integrate seamlessly since it abstracts away the ZKP complexity. This decentralized, trustless approach ensures secure, efficient, and reliable asset management and data verification.

## What makes Silvana Unique?
- **Zero-Knowledge, Zero Complexity**: Silvana hides cryptographic complexity, letting developers build with familiar tools while ZKPs ensure data integrity and privacy. No need to learn new languages or systems: Silvana handles the infrastructure so you can focus on app logic.

- **Object-Centric Architecture**: assets are treated as self-contained objects with mutable states and business logic. This enables automation, better data modeling, and event-driven design.

- **Modular Application Layer**: use or build custom modules to implement business use cases: from document verification to supply chain management, DEXs, or real estate operations.

- **Composability Across Chains**: Silvana integrates seamlessly with blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, Mina, Sui, and others. It fits into your existing infrastructure instead of forcing you to adapt to a new one.

- **Trustless Verification**: every change in Silvana is accompanied by a ZK proof that can be verified by anyone, independently. This ensures data validity without relying on intermediaries or custodial trust.

- **Highly-scalable, ultra-fast**: Silvana utilizes **Silvana Rollup** - a hybrid rollup integration, blending the high scalability of **optimistic rollups** with the cryptographic guarantees of **ZK-rollups**. This ensures rapid proof generation and high-speed transaction execution without compromising on integrity.

- **Decentralized**: the **Silvana Network** is a decentralized prover network composed of independently operated nodes that generate **zkProofs**. This structure ensures high-quality, low-latency proofs at competitive cost, eliminating reliance on centralized verification infrastructure.

- **Flexible Deployment**: applications can run in **cloud (CXE)**, **private (PXE)**, or **Secure Enclave (TEE)** environments. This flexibility allows teams to optimize for compliance, latency, or control without changing their application logic.
