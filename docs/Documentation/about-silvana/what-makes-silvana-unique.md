# What makes Silvana Unique?

## What makes Silvana Unique?
- **Zero-Knowledge, Zero Complexity**: Silvana hides cryptographic complexity, letting developers build with familiar tools while ZKPs ensure data integrity and privacy. No need to learn new languages or systems: Silvana handles the infrastructure so you can focus on app logic.
- **Object-Centric Architecture**: assets are treated as self-contained objects with mutable states and business logic. This enables automation, better data modeling, and event-driven design.
- **Modular Application Layer**: use or build custom modules to implement business use cases: from document verification to supply chain management, DEXs, or real estate operations.
- **Composability Across Chains**: Silvana integrates seamlessly with blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, Mina, Sui, and others. It fits into your existing infrastructure instead of forcing you to adapt to a new one.
- **Trustless Verification**: every change in Silvana is accompanied by a zk proof that can be verified by anyone, independently. This ensures data validity without relying on intermediaries or custodial trust.
- **Highly-scalable, ultra-fast**: Silvana utilizes **Silvana Rollup** - a hybrid rollup integration, blending the high scalability of **optimistic rollups** with the cryptographic guarantees of [**ZK-rollups**](/Documentation/glossary#zk-rollup). This ensures rapid [**proof generation**](/Documentation/glossary#proof-generation) and high-speed transaction execution without compromising on integrity.
- **Decentralized**: the **Silvana Network** is a decentralized prover network composed of independently operated nodes that generate **zk proofs**. This structure ensures high-quality, low-latency proofs at competitive cost, eliminating reliance on centralized verification infrastructure.
- **Flexible Deployment**: applications can run in **cloud (CXE)**, **private (PXE)**, or **Secure Enclave (TEE)** environments. This flexibility allows teams to optimize for compliance, latency, or control without changing their application logic.

## Silvana's Innovations in the Zero-Knowledge Technology

Unlike many projects that partially implement ZKPs, Silvana provides:

1. **True ZK Integration:** a fully private and decentralized data verification system
2. **ZK Abstraction:** businesses can use ZKPs through simple APIs without needing blockchain expertise
3. **Enforced Computational Rules:** ensures cryptographic security and prevents manipulation.
4. **Modular Architecture:** allows businesses to integrate Silvana flexibly.
5. **Ultra-fast, Scalable Solution:** most ZKP projects are computationally heavy and weigh much on CPU; Silvana uses the Coordination Layer on fast object-centric blockchains like Sui or Solana to marry the two worlds: secure and private ZKPs with fast and scalable transactions.
6. **Blockchain-Agnostic Interoperability:** compatible with various L1s, L2s, and data availability layers.
