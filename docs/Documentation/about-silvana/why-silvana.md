# Why Silvana?

## Problem Statement

Although the ZKP technology has been with us for over a decade, is highly demanded, and offers numerous use cases for businesses, it is still very early on the market. Here are some of the most critical obstacles:

1. **No Viable Web3 Private Data Verification Solution**

Current L1 and L2 blockchains struggle with enterprise data privacy and security needs. Platforms must support secure data handling, scalability, and compliance. Traditional verification requires significant data sharing, manual inspections, and reliance on third-party intermediaries. This leads to high expenses, security vulnerabilities, compliance challenges, and inefficiencies. Current solutions also have ZK complexities that need simplification to focus on business needs.

2. **No Comprehensive Package ZK Solution**

The market still lacks a comprehensive integrative ZK product that covers most use cases for private and secure data and [**proof verification**](/Documentation/glossary#proof-verification). Bridging this gap through advanced development and collaboration between tech startups and enterprises can lead to versatile, secure, and scalable blockchain solutions.

3. **Too much focus on the ZK technology while overlooking business needs**

Tech startups tend to prioritize ZKP technology for data privacy and decentralization, while businesses often focus on regulatory compliance, cost-effectiveness, development speed, data security, and customizability. Addressing these priorities requires collaboration and mutual understanding to create blockchain solutions that are both technically advanced and practically applicable, benefiting both tech innovators and traditional businesses.

4. **Project isolation**

Existing projects are normally deployed on individual networks, making them blockchain-specific and isolated and the whole ZKP landscape to a large extent fragmented. This isolation limits interoperability and scalability, preventing broader adoption and integration with other systems. Developing cross-chain solutions and enhancing interoperability could unlock the full potential of ZK-proof systems.

5. **Compliance Issues**

Maintaining regulatory standards can be onerous, as it often involves complex procedures and substantial resources, creating a significant burden on businesses. Companies must navigate an intricate web of regulations to stay compliant. In the process of complying with these standards, businesses risk exposing proprietary data, leading to potential security vulnerabilities. Achieving truly trustless solutions remains a challenge, as sensitive information must be safeguarded while ensuring regulatory compliance.

6. **Legacy Infrastructure**

Outdated, siloed systems slow down verification processes, impede collaboration, and inflate operational costs. This fragmentation leads to inefficiencies and hinders adaptation to modern business demands. Manual or double-entry processes are prone to fraud and errors, compromising data integrity and security. These vulnerabilities can result in financial losses and diminished trust, underscoring the need for automated, secure solutions.

## Silvana Mission

Silvana’s mission can be summed up in this paragraph: 

**_“We aim to revolutionize on-chain asset management by leveraging advanced zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs for robust data privacy. We address trust, security, and efficiency challenges in fragmented, opaque markets by integrating ZK and blockchain technology into a seamless, enterprise-ready platform. Our ultimate mission is to catalyze a 1000× expansion of blockchain and ZK technologies worldwide”._**

Silvana's vision is to empower businesses to conduct transactions, confidently verify, and report effectively using Zero-Knowledge (ZK)-enabled blockchain solutions. By preserving privacy, reducing operational overheads, and creating new revenue streams, Silvana aims to revolutionize the way enterprises manage their data and transactions. The company's innovative approach provides a robust foundation for businesses to operate securely and efficiently, without compromising on privacy or data integrity.

As privacy regulations become more stringent and trustless processes gain traction across various industries, such as supply chains, finance, and insurance, the demand for [**cryptographic verification**](/Documentation/glossary#cryptographic-verification) without data leakage continues to grow. Traditional solutions often fall short by requiring businesses to expose more data than necessary. Silvana's privacy-first approach fills this gap, unlocking the potential for exponential market growth in ZK and blockchain technology. By offering a scalable, privacy-centric engine, Silvana enables modern enterprises to navigate the complexities of blockchain while ensuring data security and regulatory compliance.

## What Silvana Brings to the Table

1. **Paradigm Shift: Revolutionizing Enterprise with Web3**

Blockchain development revolutionizes the enterprise landscape, meaning every component of Web3 frameworks needs to be revisited. Now, we really live up to seeing how businesses will actually enter blockchain to do things.

2. **Enhanced and Simplified Execution**

Silvana offers unmatched execution environments, comprehensive frameworks, and advanced cryptographic solutions, making it an equivalent of Amazon in the blockchain world.

3. **Modular Application Layer**

Enterprises can deploy applications with our standard or custom modules, setting a new RWA Management Standard in crypto.

4. **Limitless Opportunities**

Let the sky be your limit. Build whatever you want, integrate with whatever you need, and know no boundaries in achieving your business goals.

5. **First Viable Implementation of ZK Cryptography**

Although ZK unlocks a wide array of robust use cases, it is still early since most projects leveraging ZKPs still haven’t demonstrated a viable business solution. We really know how to make ZKPs grow from an intricately designed yet opaque to a truly utilizable technology.
