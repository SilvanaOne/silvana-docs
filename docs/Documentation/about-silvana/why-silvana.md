# Why Silvana?

## Problem Statement

Although the ZKP technology has been with us for over a decade, is highly demanded, and offers numerous use cases for businesses, it is still very early on the market. Here are some of the most critical headwinds:

1. **No Viable Comprehensive Private Data Verification Solution**

Current L1 and L2 blockchains fall short of privacy needs, where traditional verification demands heavy data sharing, manual checks, and third-party reliance – driving up costs, risks, and inefficiencies. Existing ZK solutions add further complexity, underscoring the need for simpler, business-focused approaches.

2. **Too much focus on the ZK technology while overlooking business needs**

Startups often prioritize ZKP technology, while businesses focus on compliance, cost, speed, security, and customization. Bridging these priorities through collaboration can deliver blockchain solutions that are both technically advanced and business-ready.

3. **Ecosystem Fragmentation**

Most projects run on isolated networks, leaving the ZKP landscape fragmented and limiting interoperability, scalability, and adoption. Cross-chain solutions and greater interoperability are key to unlocking their full potential.

4. **Compliance Issues**

Regulatory compliance is resource-intensive, forcing companies through complex procedures that risk exposing proprietary data and creating security gaps. The challenge lies in safeguarding sensitive information while meeting strict standards and striving for truly trustless solutions.

5. **Legacy Infrastructure**

Outdated, siloed systems slow down verification, hinder collaboration, and raise costs. Fragmentation and manual processes invite errors and fraud, compromising data integrity and trust – highlighting the need for automated, secure solutions.

## Silvana Mission

Silvana’s mission can be summed up in this paragraph: 

**_“We aim to revolutionize on-chain asset management by leveraging advanced zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs for robust data privacy. We address trust, security, and efficiency challenges in fragmented, opaque markets by integrating ZK and blockchain technology into a seamless, enterprise-ready platform. Our ultimate mission is to catalyze a 1000× expansion of blockchain and ZK technologies worldwide”._**

## What Silvana Brings to the Table

1. **First Viable ZK Implementation**

Although ZK unlocks a wide array of robust use cases, it is still early since most projects leveraging ZKPs still haven’t demonstrated a viable business solution. We really know how to make ZKPs grow from an intricately designed yet opaque to a truly utilizable technology.

2. **Paradigm Shift: Bridging Corporate Business with Web3**

Blockchain development revolutionizes the corporate landscape, meaning every component of Web3 frameworks needs to be revisited. Now, we really live up to seeing how businesses will actually enter blockchain to do things.

3. **Tech Abstraction for Better Focus on Business Needs**

Now there’s no need to be a cryptography ace to build nice apps with private data. With Silvana, it can be done with simple lines of code, empowering customers to focus on business, leaving the tech on us.

4. **Ecosystem Integration**

Silvana is thought to become a hub that will integrate various projects: L1 and L2s, DA layers, to overcome the fragmentation and use the best of what each project offers. We offer bridgeless interoperability, meaning that native assets can be managed cross-chain without the need to use a bridge.

5. **Ensured Legal and Contractual Compliance**

Zero-knowledge proofs can be used to verify that businesses meet all legal and contractual requirements and are in good standing.

6. **Flexible and Easy App Building and Setup**

All apps are modular and composable. You can assemble them like a constructor. All interfaces are familiar and simple. You can easily integrate the data, processes, assets, interfaces, and systems you already have. Everything is mutable and configurable.
