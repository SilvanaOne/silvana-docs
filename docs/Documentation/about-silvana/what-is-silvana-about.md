# What is Silvana About?

## Welcome to Silvana
What's Silvana in short? It's a private, decentralized proving engine and operating system that allows off- and on-chain businesses to own and control their data and assets across multiple networks and corporate systems of their choice without the need to use a bridge with cryptographically enforced logic and blazing-fast execution.

Silvana leverages zero-knowledge proofs to let businesses prove authenticity, compliance, and ownership without exposing sensitive data. By turning assets into provable objects and applying business rules through modular applications, Silvana bridges corporate finance and crypto, enabling secure transactions, verification, and reporting with confidence.

# Silvana Fundamentals
Silvana solution rests on these pillars:

### Viable ZK Implementation

Silvana is among the most viable zk solutions today, delivering efficient, fully cryptographic privacy without reliance on partial trust, without a trade-off on the execution speed.

### Enforced Computational Rules

All data and transactions follow cryptographically enforced rules that prevent manipulation, safeguard integrity, and ensure security – guaranteeing trust and reliability in every operation.

### Layered Privacy

There are many ways to skin a cat when it comes to ensuring user privacy – whether through zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), trusted execution environments (TEE), or multi-party computation (MPC). You decide what level of protection your data needs, if any.

### Modular, Blockchain-Agnostic, and Scalable Architecture

Silvana’s modular architecture is designed with scalability in mind, providing plug-and-play cryptographic solutions that integrate seamlessly with enterprise systems, L1s, L2s, DA layers, and diverse proof systems – reducing friction, ensuring interoperability, and enabling scalable adoption without lock-in.

### Totally Abstracted

We hide the complexities of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology from the user, making it accessible even to those without deep blockchain expertise. By providing intuitive interfaces like REST APIs and SQL, Silvana allows users to interact seamlessly with the system. Multiple languages and proof systems are supported. All in all, Silvana is hardwired to make life easier for devs.

### Bridging Corporate and Web3

Silvana bridges Web3 and traditional companies with a universal layer for verifiable computation, enabling trustworthy proofs and confidential inputs across both on-chain and off-chain applications. We pave the way for corporate customers to enter Web3 with their assets, data, and systems.

### Integration over Competition

We aren’t in the rat race for the market share; instead of following the zero-sum thinking, it successfully integrates networks, creating a win-win situation by amplifying existing ecosystems and growing the whole pie.

### Rollup As A Service

Every app is deployed as a multi-based rollup, meaning each component can be on any network out there. That empowers you to pick the battle-tested blockchains for increased performance.

### Ultra Rollup

At the heart of Silvana is its ultra-fast Rollup and Coordination Layer, using high-performance blockchains for execution and efficient proof aggregation for settlement, creating a high-speed backbone that delivers lightning-fast, privacy-preserving transactions with minimal latency.

### Optimistic State with Guaranteed Finality

Ultra Rollup marries the best of the two worlds: optimistic state on a fast execution network and guaranteed finality on the settlement network that supports zk proofs.

### Custom Logic with Modular Apps

Silvana makes app development as simple as assembling Lego blocks, with atomic modules that can be combined into custom applications to streamline logic, reduce complexity, and accelerate iteration.

### Agent-Driven Execution

Agents whap core components into unified, programmable interfaces and perform operations within an app for automation.

### Flexible Deployment

Silvana gives developers unmatched deployment flexibility by letting each component run privately, in TEE, or Silvana Cloud, allowing teams to balance control, security, and scalability without lock-in.

### Bridgeless Interoperability

Coordination layer allows to manage assets on multiple without using a bridge, and therefore, bypass the bottlenecks and pitfalls associated with it.

### All Data is Accepted

Silvana turns any data into zero-knowledge–ready artifacts, enabling proofs across chains, clouds, and codebases so that all information is verifiable without disclosure, unlocking trust, interoperability, and privacy for next-generation workflows.

### SQL-Compatible

Silvana supports SQL-compatible verifiable computation, letting developers query and transform data from any source with familiar syntax while adding ZK assurance for building trustworthy apps.

### Provable Database

All assets and data are stored as provable objects, and every state change automatically generates a proof—ensuring each object remains authentic and tamper-free.

### Full Asset History

Multiple proofs can be aggregated in a single recursive proof, which means that at any time full asset history can be retrieved.

### Confidential Computation

With TEE and MPC, execution runs within a customer’s secured enclave according to the preset cryptographic rules that no one can access, making sure no outsider or insider can tamper with the operation.
