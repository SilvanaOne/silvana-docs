# ZKP Scalability Dilemma

## Overview

The ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proof) Scalability Dilemma represents a fundamental challenge in implementing zero-knowledge proof systems at scale. This document explores the trade-offs and solutions that Silvana employs to address this challenge.

## The Core Dilemma

The ZKP Scalability Dilemma consists of three main trade-offs:

1. **Proof Generation Time vs. Verification Time**
   - Faster proof generation often leads to longer verification times
   - Optimizing for verification can increase proof generation time
   - Balance between prover and verifier efficiency

2. **Proof Size vs. Security**
   - Smaller proofs may compromise security
   - More secure proofs tend to be larger
   - Trade-off between storage/transmission costs and security guarantees

3. **Computational Resources vs. Decentralization**
   - Higher computational requirements can limit decentralization
   - More decentralized systems may have higher resource requirements
   - Balance between system performance and network participation

## Silvana's Approach
