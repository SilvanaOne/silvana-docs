# DA Transaction

The final stage of the lifecycle occurs on the [**Data Availability (DA) Layer**](/Documentation/architecture/Layers/data-availability-layer), anchored to a public Layer 1 blockchain. This stage ensures that the transaction data, along with its proof artifacts, are permanently recorded and verifiable on-chain.

As a transaction runs with a [**provable record**](/Documentation/key-concepts/provable-records), its state is mutated, for which a proof is generated. Then the proofs are stored in the DA Layer.

Example of a [**DA Transaction**](https://suiscan.xyz/devnet/tx/5S91htVLBAvqa9VaJS7exyMETfHGc5uzRKyzMwaZGfPZ).
