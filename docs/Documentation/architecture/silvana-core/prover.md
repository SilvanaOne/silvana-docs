# Prover
## Overview
The **Silvana Prover** is directly related to **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)** technology. It produces cryptographic proofs that confirm the validity of statements or transitions in Provable Records while preserving the confidentiality of the underlying sensitive information. 

Its functionality is essential, like the engine in a car, making it a critical driver of the entire system. Without a prover, the purpose and functionality of Silvana is fundamentally compromised. Utilizing zero-knowledge technology, Silvana ensures secure and private transactions without compromising data integrity or compliance.
