# Integration Layer

This is the highest-level layer, where consumers integrate what Silvana offers into their application architecture.

Silvana can be used by individual **enterprises** from different industries, **tech startups**, **industry integrators**, and other **consumers**. Enterprises can integrate directly by using modules or Silvana Core in different execution environments, either by forking module repos in their private execution environment by using Silvana Cloud or developing their own modules to meet their business needs. On the other hand, companies can join Silvana via industry integrators - bigger aggregators with extensive experience and expertise in an industry (DeFis, accounting, audit, insurance, real estate, etc.). They can also use Silvana modules and Core or develop new modules themselves.
