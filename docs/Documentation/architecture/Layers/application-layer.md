# Application Layer

This is the layer where the business logic is represented for end users â€” consumers, **enterprises** (**startups**), and **industry integrators**. It is represented by multiple modules tailored to a specific business use case (document verification, NFTs, exchange, car rental, etc.). 

Each module is essentially deployed as code that end users can access in a mono repo. We offer some of the most common modules to cover a wide range of use cases. Additionally, our customers and system integrators can add their modules to extend the application layer's functionality. Some basic modules are provided by Silvana and are open for public use. Such modules will initially include the following:

* Transactions Module

* NFT Module

* Fungible Tokens Module

* DEX Module

* Token Launchpad Module

* and more...

With time, more such modules will be added. Enterprises, integrators, and developers can additionally develop more modules to meet their business requirements, too. This will enrich our Application layers and cover more and more use cases.
