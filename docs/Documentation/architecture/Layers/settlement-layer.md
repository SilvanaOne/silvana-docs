# Settlement Layer

The **Settlement Layer** is the lowest-level part of Silvanaâ€™s architecture. In other words, this is the blockchain layer, where transactions are signed by a set of validators to ensure transaction consistency and validity. As transactions are validated, they are added to an L1 or L2 blockchain. Keeping transactions on-chain ensures data security and consistency.
