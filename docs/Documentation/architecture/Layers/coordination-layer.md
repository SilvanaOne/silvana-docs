# Coordination Layer

Transactions involving **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** are generally computationally heavy and, therefore, take longer time. That’s the reason why most ZK L1 or L2 projects lack scalability. Silvana built its **Coordination Layer** to ensure fast and secure transactions with ZKPs. The Coordination Layer is based on a network that can guarantee fast transaction execution. It aggregates proofs and has a Sequencer to queue proofs and transactions and batch them in a block. Once a block is built, it is sent to the Settlement Layer, which is a ZK network. Silvana’s Coordination Layer helps to take the best of the two worlds: the high scalability of the blockchain where transactions are executed, and the data security of the blockchain leveraging zero-knowledge proofs.
