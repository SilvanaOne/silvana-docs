# Business Context

## Our Mission

We aim to revolutionize on-chain asset management by leveraging advanced zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs for robust data privacy. We address trust, security, and efficiency challenges in fragmented, opaque markets by integrating ZK and blockchain technology into a seamless, enterprise-ready platform. Our ultimate mission is to catalyze a 1000× expansion of blockchain and ZK technologies worldwide.

{ value: 'Opportunity', label: '2', content: <> As privacy regulations tighten and trustless processes gain traction in supply chains, finance, insurance, and beyond, the demand for cryptographic verification without data leakage is growing. Traditional solutions often fall short, requiring businesses to expose more data than necessary. Silvana's privacy-first approach fills this gap, unlocking the potential for 1000× market growth in ZK and blockchain technology.

## Problem Statement

### No Viable Web3 Private Data Verification Solution

- Current L1 and L2 blockchains are not hardwired to handle private data within real-world enterprise infrastructure
- Traditional verification involves extensive data sharing, manual checks, and dependence on third-party intermediaries, resulting in high costs, security breaches, compliance issues, and inefficiencies
- Existing solutions contain a lot of ZK complexities that must be abstracted away to get the focus on business needs and applications

## How Silvana Can Apply

The table below features the use cases we're targeting now:

| Use Case                                          | Problem                                                                                                                                                                                 | Solution                                                                                                                                                                         | Benefits                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Reinsurance                                       | Insurers need to mitigate significant risks, such as those in aviation and oil rigs, without overexposing sensitive details. Manual processes are slow and susceptible to data leakage. | Silvana leverages zero-knowledge proofs to facilitate secure quote requests from multiple reinsurers.                                                                            | - Potential 20%+ Savings on Reinsurance Premiums<br/>- Larger Pool of Reinsurers<br/>- Automated Compliance Checks |
| Bookkeeping, Accounting, Due Diligence, and Audit | Traditional accounting methods are susceptible to human error, fraud, and slow reconciliation processes.                                                                                | Silvana's object-centric, event-based architecture revolutionizes accounting by transforming double-entry systems into triple-entry accounting, complete with on-chain receipts. | - Continuous Auditing<br/>- Preserved Privacy<br/>- Cost Reduction                                                 |
| Gaming Object Management                          | The state of a gaming object can be covertly altered, potentially leading to gaming fraud.                                                                                              | Silvana meticulously records and monitors the state of all created objects, ensuring comprehensive tracking and security.                                                        | - Mutable, Provable, and Traceable Object States<br/>- Private Data Concealment<br/>- Enhanced Gaming Logic        |
| Document Verification                             | Notaries are trusted to verify documents, yet instances of document forgery or criminal conspiracy still occur.                                                                         | Silvana ensures document validity and verifies ownership, providing a secure and reliable solution.                                                                              | - Eliminated Fraud and Forgery Risk<br/>- Continuous Document Availability<br/>- Private Data Concealed            |

## Truth Marketplace

One of the Marketplace corner cases is Silvana's Truth Marketplace, the proof marketplace. There are multiple proofs for a single operation with a provable record. Some may be more truthful and trustworthy than others. Truth Marketplace helps users find and obtain them.

This is the normal flow of Silvana's Truth Marketplace:

<NumberedList
  items={[
    'Marketplace users can buy and sell proofs of truth, some access-based',
    'Enterprises might sell reconciliation proofs to counterparties for year-end financial liabilities, enabling compliance or audit checks without revealing full data sets',
    'Combining multiple proofs increases the overall "truth probability," considering correlations',
