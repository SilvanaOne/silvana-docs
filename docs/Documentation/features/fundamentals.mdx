# Silvana Fundamentals

Silvana's architecture is built on several key principles that set it apart from other blockchain solutions:

## True ZK Integration

Unlike many "privacy" solutions that rely on partial trust, Silvana is a comprehensive cryptography-driven system. Our platform implements true zero-knowledge proofs at its core, ensuring complete privacy while maintaining verifiability.

## Private Data Proving & Enforcement

Unlike typical public blockchain solutions, Silvana generates proofs without exposing underlying data. It leverages decentralized data availability and enforced computational rules to mitigate the risk of data manipulation.

## Enforced Computational Rules

All data and transactions adhere to cryptographically guaranteed logic, preventing manipulation. This ensures the integrity of operations while maintaining privacy.

## Modular, Scalable Architecture

Silvana offers plug-and-play components suitable for various industries, minimizing integration friction. Our modular design allows for:

- Easy customization
- Flexible deployment
- Seamless scalability
- Industry-specific adaptations

## ZK Complexity Hidden from the User

Users can interact via REST APIs and SQL interfaces without in-depth blockchain expertise. We abstract away the complexity of:

- Zero-knowledge proofs
- Cryptographic operations
- Blockchain interactions

## Blockchain-Agnostic & Expandable

Silvana integrates with multiple blockchain platforms and services:

- Mina
- SUI
- Walrus
- IPFS
- "Project Untitled" for data availability
- Any blockchain supporting ZK proofs

## Object-Centric Model

This model focuses on assets and events rather than just accounts, enabling flexible and intuitive solutions. Benefits include:

- Natural business process mapping
- Improved data organization
- Enhanced traceability
- Better scalability

## Decentralized Data Availability with Staking

More robust than SLA agreements, this approach ensures data remains available and tamper-resistant on a permissionless layer, utilizing staked nodes for resilience. Key features:

- Distributed data storage
- Stake-based security
- High availability
- Tamper resistance

| Standard REST APIs and SQL interfaces                             |                  |
| Decentralized data availability                                   |                  |
| Marketplace                                                       |                  |

We use existing solutions for the settlement and consensus layers and proof systems and successfully integrate them into Silvana.
