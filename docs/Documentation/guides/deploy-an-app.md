# How to Deploy an App

Let‚Äôs see how to deploy an app on an example of a simple addition program using the Silvana framework. The program showcases the integration between Sui Move contracts, TypeScript agents, and Mina zkApps.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, make sure you have these **tools** installed:

1. Node.js and npm

```javascript
node --version  # Should be v22 or higher
npm --version
```

2. Sui CLI

Follow the installation instructions at [Sui Documentation](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install).

```javascript
sui --version
```

3. Docker

  - Download from [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
  - Ensure Docker is running before proceeding

```javascript
docker --version
```

4. Silvana CLI

```javascript
# Quick install
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SilvanaOne/silvana/main/install.sh | bash

# Verify installation
silvana --version
```
## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create a New Project
Use the Silvana CLI to create a new project from the template:

```javascript
silvana new myprogram
```
This command will:
- Download the project template;
- Generate Sui and Mina keypairs for both user and Coordinator;
- Automatically fund all accounts from testnets;
- Fetch devnet configuration;
- Create a Silvana registry on-chain;
- Store the agent's private key in secure storage;
- Generate environment files with all necessary configuration.

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project
Run this command:

```javascript
cd myprogram
```
Your project structure will look like this:

```javascript

 üìÅ Project structure:
    myprogram/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent/     # TypeScript agent implementation
    |     src/     # Agent source code
    |     .env     # Agent configuration (auto-generated)
    |     .env.app # App-specific configuration (empty initially)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ move/      # Move smart contracts
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ silvana/   # Silvana Coordinator
         .env      # Coordinator configuration (auto-generated)
```

### Step 3: Build and Deploy Move Contract
Navigate to the move directory and deploy your smart contract:

```javascript
cd move

# Switch to devnet
sui client switch --env devnet

# Check your addresses
sui client addresses

# Request funds if needed
sui client faucet

# Check balance
sui client balance

# Build the Move contract
sui move build

# Publish the contract
sui client publish
```

After publishing, you'll see output containing the PackageID, like:

```javascript
PackageID: 0xf238cb13361d361c6324e069b99a2ebccbd69c3ac703b25c2f0ee41e7924736b
```
:::warning Warning
Copy this PackageID and add it to your `agent/.env` file: `APP_PACKAGE_ID=0xf238cb13361d361c6324e069b99a2ebccbd69c3ac703b25c2f0ee41e7924736b`
:::

### Step 4: Build and Compile the Agent
Navigate to the agent directory and set up the TypeScript agent:

```javascript
cd agent

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the TypeScript code
npm run build

# Compile zkApp circuits (run twice to generate full prover keys)
npm run compile
npm run compile
```
:::warning Warning
The `npm run compile` command needs to be run twice to create a complete set of zk prover keys for the Mina zkApp.
:::

### Step 5: Verify Account Funding
The setup process automatically funded your accounts, but you can verify the balances:

```javascript
# Get the Mina address from agent/.env (MINA_PUBLIC_KEY)
silvana balance mina --network mina:devnet --address <YOUR_MINA_PUBLIC_KEY>
```
You should see positive balances. Otherwise, you can manually request funds using `silvana faucet` command

### Step 6: Deploy the Application
Deploy your application to both Mina and Sui blockchains:

```javascript
# From the agent directory
npm run deploy
```

This command will:
- Deploy the Mina zkApp contract;
- Create the application on the Sui blockchain;
- Register the app in the Silvana registry;
- Generate the app instance configuration.

You should see an output of this type:

```javascript
App initialized successfully
‚úÖ App created successfully!
üì¶ App ID: 0x40deec126c7f08ce85135381646759533e6c7e1c5193674e4e71091052d18822
üì¶ Registry: 0x5124fbb1d17eccccd42128233fbfbfc0657a5065aa878536f724aa1fe8d6f619
üíæ Configuration saved to .env.app
App instance ID: 0xaacf350ac6ae669ebf9804b455b0bc75a71f28a34bdc48d87ca78f1f90ba0f3b
Mina contract address: B62qoRvnY827gKNPy6yTWM9iwQJ9JGXu7MPDU9GCzSUpccELfThGRCE
Mina admin address: B62qoiTzbVwoQorP4ys8YKtP5kYWk46BRzeoxwb6xSnx2kLzZJQrEnG
```
The deployment will automatically save the configuration to `.env.app` file with:
- **App ID**: the unique identifier for your application;
- **App instance ID**: the specific instance of your deployed app;
- **Mina contract address**: the deployed zkApp address on Mina;
- **Registry information**: connection to the Silvana registry.

### Step 7: Start the Silvana Coordinator
Open a new terminal window and navigate to the silvana folder:

```javascript
cd silvana
silvana start
```

:::warning Warning
To ensure proper process management, use a regular system terminal for this step, not an integrated terminal in your IDE.
:::

The Coordinator will:
- Connect to the Sui blockchain;
- Monitor for incoming jobs;
- Coordinate execution between the agent and blockchain;
- Handle settlement and verification.

You should see the Coordinator starting up and waiting for jobs. Keep this terminal running. The Coordinator performs the following initialization steps:

1. **Configuration Loading**: fetches devnet configuration from the RPC server and injects environment variables.
2. **Sui Connection**: connects to the Sui blockchain RPC endpoint.
3. **Balance Check**: verifies sufficient SUI balance for operations.
4. **Gas Coin Pool**: initializes a pool of gas coins by splitting large coins for better transaction performance.
5. **Service Startup**: starts multiple background services:
   - **Job Searcher**: monitors for new jobs on the blockchain;
   - **Multicall Processor**: batches multiple operations for efficiency;
   - **Docker Buffer Processor**: manages Docker container execution;
   - **Event Monitor**: watches blockchain events;
   - **gRPC Server**: provides API for agent communication;
   - **Periodic Tasks**: runs reconciliation, block creation, and proof analysis.

Once running, the Coordinator will:

- Detect new jobs created on the blockchain;
- Launch Docker containers to execute agent code;
- Process job results and update blockchain state;
- andle proof generation and settlement.

You'll see logs like:

```javascript
üìù JobCreated: seq=4, dev=AddDeveloper, agent=AddAgent/prove, app_method=add
üê≥ Starting Docker container for buffered job 1: AddDeveloper/AddAgent/prove
‚úÖ Job 1 started and reserved for Docker session
```

### Step 8: Send Test Transactions
With the Coordinator running, open another terminal and navigate to the agent directory to send test transactions:

```javascript
cd agent
npm run batch
```
This command runs a batch test that sends multiple transactions to your deployed application. You'll see output like:

```javascript
> add@0.1.0 batch
> npm run test test/batch.test.ts

[2025-09-09T23:02:48.875Z] Batch iteration 1 - Max delay: 13.718s - Total TX: 0 - TPS: 0
wait sui tx: 108.765ms
wait sui tx: 113.928ms
wait sui tx: 3.267s
...
[2025-09-09T23:04:59.263Z] Batch iteration 2 - Max delay: 20.926s - Total TX: 10 - TPS: 0.077
```
The batch test:
- Sends multiple addition requests to the Sui blockchain;
- Each transaction creates a job that the Coordinator detects;
- The Coordinator launches Docker containers to process each job;
- Results are computed, proven with zkSNARKs, and settled on-chain.

:::tip Success
**Congratulations!** Your first Silvana app is now up and running!
:::

You've successfully:
- ‚úÖ Created a new Silvana project with the automated setup;
- ‚úÖ Deployed a Move smart contract on Sui;
- ‚úÖ Built and compiled a TypeScript agent with zkSNARK circuits;
- ‚úÖ Deployed a Mina zkApp for proof verification;
- ‚úÖ Started the Silvana Coordinator to orchestrate execution;
- ‚úÖ Sent transactions that trigger distributed computation.

Your application is now processing addition operations across multiple blockchains:
- **Sui** handles job creation, proving orchestration and optimistic state calculations;
- **Docker containers** execute the computation securely;
- **Mina** verifies zero-knowledge proofs of correct execution;
- **Silvana** coordinates the entire workflow.

## Running Agent on Silvana Devnet
Instead of running your own Coordinator, you can deploy your application to the Silvana devnet, where it will be processed by the shared Silvana infrastructure.

### Option 1: Deploy to Shared Silvana Devnet
To use the shared Silvana devnet registry:

1. **Get the devnet registry ID**:

```javascript
silvana config
```
Look for:

```javascript
SILVANA_REGISTRY = 0x916a3b24de8165fb6fb25d060ec82b50683dc9e9cebf0dfae559f943ee32adb2
SILVANA_REGISTRY_PACKAGE = 0x32f8ad21df94c28401912c8ffebcc3bd186f5bf7da0995057a63755005937025
```


2. **Update your agent configuration** to use the shared registry:

```javascript
# In agent/.env, update:
SILVANA_REGISTRY=0x916a3b24de8165fb6fb25d060ec82b50683dc9e9cebf0dfae559f943ee32adb2
SILVANA_REGISTRY_PACKAGE=0x32f8ad21df94c28401912c8ffebcc3bd186f5bf7da0995057a63755005937025
```

3. **Register your app** in the shared registry using Silvana registry commands:

```javascript
silvana registry --help
```

Your jobs will now be processed by the Silvana devnet infrastructure - no need to run your own Coordinator!

### Option 2: Join as a Devnet Operator
To contribute computing power to the Silvana devnet:

1. **Configure your Coordinator** to use the shared registry:

```javascript
# In silvana/.env, set:
SILVANA_REGISTRY=0x916a3b24de8165fb6fb25d060ec82b50683dc9e9cebf0dfae559f943ee32adb2
SILVANA_REGISTRY_PACKAGE=0x32f8ad21df94c28401912c8ffebcc3bd186f5bf7da0995057a63755005937025
```
2. **Start your Coordinator**:

```javascript
cd silvana
silvana start
```
Your Coordinator will now process jobs from all applications registered in the shared devnet registry.

## Amending the Code
When you want to modify the application logic and deploy your own version:

### Step 1: Modify the Circuit Logic
Edit `agent/src/circuit.ts` to implement your custom computation logic. This file contains the zkSNARK circuit that defines what computation will be proven and verified.

### Step 2: Configure Docker Hub
Before building and pushing your Docker image, configure your Docker Hub credentials in `agent/.env`:

```javascript
# Edit agent/.env and add your Docker Hub credentials:
DOCKER_USERNAME=your-dockerhub-username
DOCKER_PASSWORD=your-dockerhub-password
IMAGE_NAME=your-image-name (like 'add')
DOCKER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-docker-access-token
```
To get a Docker Access Token, follow these steps:
1. Log in to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).
2. Go to Account Settings ‚Üí Security.
3. Create a New Access Token.
4. Copy the token to `DOCKER_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

### Step 3: Build and Deploy
After making your changes, rebuild and deploy your agent:

```javascript
cd agent

# Build the TypeScript code
npm run build

# Compile the zkApp circuits (run twice for complete prover keys)
npm run compile
npm run compile

# Build and push Docker image with your agent and prover keys
npm run docker
```

This process:
- **Builds** your modified TypeScript code;
- **Compiles** the zkSNARK circuits to generate prover/verifier keys;
- **Creates** a Docker image containing your agent code and prover keys;
- **Pushes** the image to Docker Hub under your account.

### Step 4: Update Your App Configuration
After pushing your new Docker image, update your app to use it:

1. Note your new Docker image URL: `docker.io/your-username/your-image-name:latest`.
2. Update your app configuration to reference this new image.
3. Redeploy your app with `npm run deploy`.

:::warning Warning
The compiled **prover keys** are large (can be several GB) and are included in the Docker image. Therefore, the docker image can be large, too.
:::



:::warning Warning
You should use a **public Docker repository** to ensure that the Coordinator will be able to pull the image.
:::

## Troubleshooting
In the table below, see typical issues you may encounter and how you can handle them:

| **Issue** | **How to Fix** |
|------------|----------------|
| The Coordinator refuses to detect jobs | Ensure the Coordinator is running and connected to the correct **SILVANA_REGISTRY_PACKAGE** and **SILVANA_REGISTRY** on Sui Devnet. |
| Docker error | Verify Docker Desktop is running and you're logged in to Docker Hub. |
| Insufficient balance | Run `silvana faucet` commands to request more tokens. |
| Transaction failures | Check the explorer for detailed error messages and look at the Coordinator logs in the terminal. |
| Debugging | Use `silvana instance` command to show App Instance state, `silvana block`, `silvana proofs` commands to show block information and aggregated proof production details for the block, and `silvana jobs` and `silvana job` commands to show the details about proving, merging and settlement jobs being run by Coordinators. |
| Manual transactions | Use `silvana transaction` to manually execute transactions for your App Instance. |
